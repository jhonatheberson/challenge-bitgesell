# Solution Approach and Trade-offs

## 1. Non-blocking I/O Implementation

### Approach

- Refactored blocking I/O operations to use non-blocking async operations
- Implemented proper error handling and async/await patterns
- Ensured consistent error responses across the application

### Trade-offs

- **Pros:**
  - Improved server responsiveness
  - Better resource utilization
  - Enhanced scalability
- **Cons:**
  - Increased code complexity
  - Requires careful error handling
  - More complex debugging process

## 2. Performance Optimization with Caching

### Approach

- Implemented caching mechanism for `/api/stats` endpoint
- Added file modification tracking
- Cache invalidation based on data changes

### Implementation Details

1. Receives request to `/api/stats`
2. Checks if data file has been modified since last cache
3. Returns cached data if valid
4. Recalculates statistics if cache is invalid
5. Updates cache with new metadata

### Trade-offs

- **Pros:**
  - Reduced server load
  - Faster response times
  - Efficient resource usage
- **Cons:**
  - Additional memory usage for cache
  - Need to manage cache invalidation
  - Potential stale data if cache invalidation fails

## 3. Memory Leak Prevention

### Approach

- Created asynchronous `loadItems` function
- Implemented component mount state tracking
- Added cleanup logic for unmounting

### Implementation Details

- Encapsulated fetch logic in `loadItems`
- Added active flag checks before state updates
- Implemented proper cleanup on unmount

### Trade-offs

- **Pros:**
  - Prevents memory leaks
  - Cleaner component lifecycle
  - Better error handling
- **Cons:**
  - Additional state management
  - Slightly more complex component logic
  - Need to maintain active flag state

## 4. Pagination & Search Implementation

### Backend Improvements

- Added page and limit parameters
- Implemented name and category search
- Enhanced parameter validation
- Added pagination metadata

### Frontend Improvements

- Updated DataContext for pagination
- Enhanced Items component
- Improved user experience

### Trade-offs

- **Pros:**
  - Better performance with large datasets
  - Improved user experience
  - Reduced server load
- **Cons:**
  - More complex API endpoints
  - Additional state management
  - Need to handle edge cases

## 5. Virtualization Integration

### Approach

- Integrated react-window and react-virtualized-auto-sizer
- Implemented FixedSizeGrid
- Created ItemCard component
- Added AutoSizer for container dimensions

### Implementation Details

- Replaced regular grid with virtualized grid
- Optimized rendering of large lists
- Improved scroll performance

### Trade-offs

- **Pros:**
  - Significantly improved performance with large lists
  - Reduced memory usage
  - Better scroll performance
- **Cons:**
  - More complex implementation
  - Additional dependencies
  - Need to handle dynamic content carefully

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Implemented Jest tests for items routes
- Covered happy path scenarios
- Added error case handling
- Ensured proper test coverage

### Trade-offs

- **Pros:**
  - Improved code reliability
  - Better error handling
  - Easier maintenance
- **Cons:**
  - Additional development time
  - Need to maintain test suite
  - More complex CI/CD pipeline
